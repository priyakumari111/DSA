DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms) 
DSA is the study of organizing data efficiently using data structures like arrays, stacks, and trees, paired with step-by-step procedures (or algorithms) to solve problems effectively.
Data structures manage how data is stored and accessed, while algorithms focus on processing this data.


For starting with DSA firstly,
         --> Learn atleast one programming language.
         --> Learn about Time and Space Complexities.
         --> Learn Data Structures and Algorithms.
         --> Practice and Practice and Practice more.
         --> Complete and become a Pro.
